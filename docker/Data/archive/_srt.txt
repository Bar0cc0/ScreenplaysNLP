Last night's time travel experiment
was apparently a complete success.

26
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,671
Lightning struck the clock tower
at precisely 10:04 p.m.

27
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,590

into the time vehicle,

that Marty and the time vehicle

were transported forward through time

In fact, I don't even remember
how I got home.

33
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,153
Perhaps the gigawatt discharge
coupled with the temporal displacement field

34
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,657
generated by the time vehicle caused
a disruption of my own brain waves

00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,286
I wonder.

153
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,456
Could I go to the library and look myself up
in the old newspaper archives?

154
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,917
I don't know, Doc. You're the one
that's always saying, you know,

155
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,003
it's not good to know too much
about your own destiny.

156
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,589
You're right, Marty.
I know too much already.

157
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:23,803
Better that I not attempt to uncover
the circumstances of my own future.

I'll get him, Doc. Copernicus!

Copernicus, come on. Let's go home, boy.

161

"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."

DOC: "Shot in the back
by Buford Tannen over a matter of $80"?

What kind of a future do you call that?

179
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,873
MARTY: "Buford Tannen
was a notorious gunman

"whose short temper
and a tendency to drool

was William. That's him. Good-looking guy.

00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,744
McFlys, but no Browns.

192
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,038
Well, maybe it was a mistake, Doc.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

193
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,416
There could've been
another Emmett Brown back in 1885.

194
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,500
- No.
- I don't know.

195

Did you have any relatives here back then?

196
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,753
The Browns didn't come
to Hill Valley until 1908.

197
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,463
And then they were the von Brauns.

It is me who goes back there and gets shot.

It's not gonna happen, Doc.

205
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,860
After you fix the time circuits
and put new tires on the DeLorean,

206
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,405
I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

- The clothes fit?
- (AIR HISSING)

MARTY: Yeah, everything
except the boots, Doc. They're kind of tight.

209
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,841
I don't know.
Are you sure this stuff is authentic?

210
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,261
Of course. Haven't you ever seen a Western?

211
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,222
Yeah, I have, Doc.

212
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,184
Clint Eastwood
never wore anything like this.

213
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,147
- Clint who?
- That's right. You haven't heard of him yet.

214
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,065
Marty, you have to wear the boots.

215
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,818
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

216
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,778
You shouldn't even be wearing them
here in 1955.

217
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,364
All right, Doc. Look, as soon as I get there,
I'll put them on. I promise.

218
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,451
Okay. I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.

Oh! What about that floating device?

222
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,836
- Hoverboard.
- All right.

223
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,383
You know, Doc, it's gonna be a hell
of a long walk back to Hill Valley from here.

224
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,760
It's still the safest plan.

225
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,554
After all, we can't risk sending you back
into a populated area

226

or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

227
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,352
You don't want to crash into some tree
that once existed in the past.

228
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,896
This was all completely open country,

229
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,607
so you'll have plenty of run out space
when you arrive.

230
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,818
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

231
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,531
There's a small cave over there which will be
a perfect place to hide the time vehicle.

are warmed up.

September 2nd, 1885, 8:00 a.m.

236
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,674
I get shot on Monday the 7th,
so you have five days to locate me.

237
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,094
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,721
All you have to do is drive the time vehicle

239
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,392
directly toward that screen,
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

240
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,478
Wait a minute.
Doc, if I drive straight towards the screen,

241
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,063
I'm gonna crash into those Indians.

242
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,525
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

243
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,988
You'll instantly be transported to 1885,
and those Indians won't even be there.

Don't worry about that.

621
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,936
I feel somewhat responsible
for what happened.

622
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,021
Oh.

623
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,692
That would be very gentlemanly of you,
Mr. Brown. Emmett.

624
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,490
You know, I'm almost glad
that snake spooked those horses.

625
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,493
Otherwise, we might never have met.

626
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,078
I suppose it was destiny.

627
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,792
Well, thank you for everything.

628

630
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,928
Of course. You'll see lots of me. I'm sure.
I have a shop in town.

631

I'm the local scientist,
(STAMMERING) blacksmith.

632
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:30,144

Astronomy? Chemistry?

633

634

Hey, Doc, we got to get going.

635
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,237
Oh, yes. Well, excuse us, Clara.

636
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,155
We have to get going.

637
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,827

638
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,171
What do you mean,
you're gonna be seeing lots of her, Doc?

639
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:00,424
Well, I might see her again just in passing.

640
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,593
Come on, Doc. Did you see the way
she was looking at you?

641
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,512
(CHUCKLES)

642
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,682
She did have quite a scare, right?

643
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,227
After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up
at the bottom of Clayton Ravine.

644
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,270
Clayton Ravine.

645
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:17,483
Holy shit. Hey, Doc, Clayton Ravine
was named after a teacher.

646
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:22,446
- They say she fell in there 100 years ago.
- 100 years ago! That's this year!

647
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,781
Every kid in school knows that story,

648
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,909
'cause we all have teachers
we'd like to see fall into the ravine.

649
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,452
Great Scott!

650
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:33,040
Then she was supposed to go over
in that wagon.

651
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,086
Now I may have seriously altered history.

652
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,257
Look, Doc, what's the worst
that can happen, huh?

653
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,718
So they don't name the ravine after her.

654
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,137
Let's just get the DeLorean ready
and get the hell out of here.

655
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,682
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

656
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,769
It's caused nothing but disaster.

657
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,649
Doc, Doc, this is Marty.

658
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,775
Do you read me? Over.

659
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:00,901
Check, Marty.

660
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,362
Great, Doc. These things still work.

661
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:08,409
All right, Marty. Once more,
let's go over the entire plan and layout.

662
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,494
I apologize for the crudity of this model,
but I just...

663
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,581
Yeah, I know, Doc.
It's not to scale. It's okay, Doc.

664
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,168
All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday,

665
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,087
we'll load the DeLorean
onto the tracks here, on the spur

666
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,506
right by the old abandoned silver mine.

667
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,384
The switch track is where
the spur runs off the main line

668
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,971
three miles out to Clayton...
Shonash Ravine.

669
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,849
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

670
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,518
We'll stop it here,
uncouple the cars from the tender,

671
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,771
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack...

672
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,816
Borrow the locomotive and use it
to push the time machine.

673
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,569
According to my calculations,
we'll reach 88 miles per hour

674
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,696
just before we hit the edge of the ravine,

675
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,408
at which point we'll be instantaneously
transported back to 1985

676
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,911
and coast safely
across the completed bridge.

677
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,747
What does this mean? "Point of no return."

678
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,250
That's our fail-safe point. Up until there,
we have still have enough time

679
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,920
to stop the locomotive
before it plunges into the ravine.

680
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,422
But once we pass this windmill,
it's the future or bust.

Emmett, when my bags
were thrown from the wagon,

701
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,539

Never considered the future, poor Martin.
God rest his soul.

930
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,863
Sure, and I hope you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

931
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,619
I think about it all the time.

in the middle north west,

933

all by itself like a starburst...

I never found lunar geography
so fascinating.

You're quite knowledgeable.

941
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,977
When I was 11, I had diphtheria.
I was quarantined for three months.

942
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,647
So my father brought this telescope,
and he put it next to my bed

943
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,317
so I could see everything out the window.

945
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,738
Emmett, do you think we'll ever be able
to travel to the moon

946
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,907
the way we travel across the country
on trains?

947
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,411
Definitely. Although not for 84 years
and not on trains.

948
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,332
We'll have space vehicles,
capsules sent aloft with rockets.

949
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,753
Devices that create giant explosions.
Explosions so powerful that they just...

950
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,963
That they break the pull
of the Earth's gravity

951
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,258
and send the projectile through outer space.

952
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,054
Emmett, I read that book, too!

953
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:12,682
You're quoting Jules Verne
From the Earth to the Moon.

954
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,060
You've read Jules Verne?

955
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,729
I adore Jules Verne.

956
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,439
So do I.

957
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,400
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.
My absolute favorite.

958
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,402
The first time I read that
when I was a little boy,

959
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,072
why, I wanted to meet Captain Nemo.

960
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,325
Don't tease, Emmett. You couldn't have
read that when you were a boy.

961
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,786
It was only first published 10 years ago.

962
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,998
Oh, yes. Well, I meant it made me
feel like a boy.

963
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:43,838
I never met a woman
who liked Jules Verne before.

964
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,302
I never ever met a man like you before.

Yeah, it's lovely, Doc.
